					My name is Nicholas Mason. I am an undergraduate with a Bachelor of Science at Simon Fraser University in the
					Interactive
					Arts & Technology program. There I learned many things including Software, web and game
					programming, Interaction Design and HCI, Java, C# and other languages, Android app development as well as more
					in-depth
					studies of algorithms in computer science courses I took.
				</p>
				<p>
					My university learnings in Android development were supplemented with work experience at Real Bean education, whom
					I worked
					for as an intern Android developer for a summer. Here I worked alongside differently-skilled developers to build
					web
					communications for the company's app, as well as the basic User Interface
				</p>
				<p>
					I am an aspiring software developer with a variety of skills in Programming languages, software development,
					version control,
					and interface design. My aspirations are to build great software, learn continually, and work alongside great
					people.

					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p class="lead">Bachelor of Science</p>
					<p>Major Interactive Arts and Technology</p>
					<p>Simon Fraser University</p>
					<p>2013-2018</p>
					<p>
						My time at Simon Fraser University came to an end so recently, and I feel that it will stay with me for the rest
						of my life.
						I learned so much in classes I took in software, programming, computer science, interface and interaction design,
						game design, as
						well as supplementary courses in writing and science.
					</p>
					<p>
						The projects I worked on reinforced my affinity for programming and software
						while also broadening my skills with projects in interface, visual and interaction design, which I find valuable
						and applicable in so
						many areas in addition to software and web development. Though University will remain one of the most valuable
						experiences I have had,
						I look forward to jumping into my career and taking the reins of life.

					<h3>Work Experience</h3>
					<p class="lead">Intern Android Developer</p>
					<p>Real Bean Education</p>
					<p>June-August 2017</p>
					<p>This was an internship I did over a summer in 2017 with Real Bean Education (a subcompany/project of Kyle
						Lawrence, a director/web developer
						at Real Bean Entertainment). My primary responsibilities were to write Java code in Android Studio to build our
						company's app. I built
						the web communication services with the company's servers and laid out the basic functionality and user interface
						of the app, as well as
						working on the documentation and JSON communication with the company's servers.
					</p>
					<p>
						This experience taught me so much about app development and web communications, Java and Android development,
						and working with other kinds of developers (specifically IOS developers). I am glad to have done this during my
						University studies as it
						supplemented my learnings with experience, and a great sense of building something useful as a change from
						personal projects.
